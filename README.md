### <a name="composer-determine-cache-directory"> `basecodeoy/.github/actions/composer/determine-cache-directory`

This action determines the cache directory for [`composer`](https://github.com/composer/composer) and exports it as [`COMPOSER_CACHE_DIR`](https://getcomposer.org/doc/03-cli.md#composer-cache-dir) environment variable.

This is useful for caching dependencies installed with `composer` using [`actions/cache`](https://github.com/actions/cache).

```yaml
name: "Integrate"

on:
  pull_request: null
  push:
    branches:
      - "main"

jobs:
  tests:
    name: "Tests"

    runs-on: "ubuntu-latest"

    steps:
      - name: "Checkout"
        uses: "actions/checkout@v3.0.2"

      - name: "Set up PHP"
        uses: "shivammathur/setup-php@2.21.2"
        with:
          coverage: "none"
          php-version: "8.1"

      - name: "Determine composer cache directory"

          path: "${{ env.COMPOSER_CACHE_DIR }}"
          key: "composer-${{ hashFiles('composer.lock') }}"
          restore-keys: "composer-"
```

For details, see [`actions/composer/determine-cache-directory/action.yaml`](actions/composer/determine-cache-directory/action.yaml).

### <a name="phive-install"> `basecodeoy/.github/actions/phive/install`

This action installs dependencies with [`phive`](https://phar.io).

```yaml
name: "Integrate"

on:
  pull_request: null
  push:
    branches:
      - "main"

jobs:
  tests:
    name: "Tests"

    runs-on: "ubuntu-latest"

    steps:
      - name: "Checkout"
        uses: "actions/checkout@v3.0.2"

      - name: "Set up PHP"
        uses: "shivammathur/setup-php@2.21.2"
        with:
          coverage: "none"
          php-version: "8.1"
          tools: "phive"

      - name: "Install dependencies with phive"
        uses: "basecodeoy/.github/actions/phive/install@1.8.0"
        with:
          trust-gpg-keys: "0x033E5F8D801A2F8D,0x2A8299CE842DD38C"
```

For details, see [`actions/phive/install/action.yaml`](actions/phive/install/action.yaml).

#### Inputs

- `phive-home`, optional: Which directory to use as `PHIVE_HOME` directory, defaults to `".build/phive"`.
- `trust-gpg-keys`, required: Which GPG keys to trust, a comma-separated list of trusted GPG keys

#### Outputs

none

#### Side Effects

- Given that `phive` is available, `phive` could find a `phars.xml`, and keys presented by packages are listed using the `trust-gpg-keys` option, dependencies are installed with `phive`.

The directory configured by the `phive-home` directory is cached using [`actions/cache`](https://github.com/actions/cache).
